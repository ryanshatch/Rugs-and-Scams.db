#### User Dustyray11 entered the De/Cap TG and shilled HOPE to the Degods and Y00ts holders. I even recieved a free airdrop for being active during the time. This token I made ~$25 from. Nothing thats too good to be true ends up without some sort of a rug. Never the less, Dustryray11 bought up ~26% of the tokens supply before he entered the TG and began the campaign. Currently his main wallet owns ~10% of the current supply and he has 25k in loans from SharkyFi.
